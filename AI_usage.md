# ðŸ§  AI Usage Report â€“ ImpulseMetrics

Throughout the development of **ImpulseMetrics**, I strategically used AI as a coding assistant to maximize productivity, ensure best practices, and accelerate frontend development workflows.

## âš¡ Key AI-Assisted Contributions

- **Component Architecture & Optimization**  
  AI assisted in structuring reusable and scalable React components â€” such as layout wrappers, metric cards, chart containers, and responsive navigation.

- **Tailwind Utility Mapping**  
  Efficiently mapped design ideas to Tailwind CSS utility classes with the help of AI, ensuring clean and responsive visual styling across breakpoints.

- **Rapid Prototyping**  
  Leveraged AI for faster iterations of UI sections, especially while planning out the dashboard layout and adjusting to various screen sizes.

- **Design Debugging & Code Review**  
  Used AI to analyze CSS glitches, fix layout issues, and maintain a consistent design system throughout the app.

- **Dummy Data Generation**  
  AI helped generate placeholder chart values, team member cards, and dummy report structures for a more dynamic and testable UI.

## ðŸ§ª Tools Used

- **AI Prompting Engine**: GPT-based assistant for code generation, debugging, utility class suggestions, and documentation writing.
- **Lovable**: Used as a no-code polish tool to visually refine component spacing and alignment without altering core code architecture.

> ðŸ’¡ *AI was used exclusively as a productivity enhancer. All final implementations were reviewed, edited, and refactored manually to ensure clarity, performance, and maintainability.*
